# Ping
This is the backend portion of the [Ping](https://github.com/Thlamz/Ping) project.

Ping is a small web mini-game/experiment. The objective is to have the highest latency! Current latency is tracked and new high scores are saved in the leaderboard. Anything is allowed, from using a VPN to unplugging your router, try to be creative to win! Latency is measured as the two-way travel time of a message between the server and the client.
